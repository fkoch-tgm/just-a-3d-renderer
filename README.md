# just-a-3d-renderer

This project is a experiment, if i can program my own 3d-rendering engine. 

Im using [Kyle Sloka-Frey](https://kyleslokafrey.com/)'s Tutorial: [Let's Build a 3D Graphics Engine: Linear Transformations](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/lets-build-a-3d-graphics-engine-linear-transformations--gamedev-7716)
